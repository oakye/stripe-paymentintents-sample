This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Assumptions
-----------
Note: both the root directory (under react-app in this sample) and the react-app/client/ directory contain subdirectories called "node_modules" that are not uploaded to this sample, for the sake of space and github generally dissuading that. We assume that you have copies of this subfolder in both the root and client/ directories. (* Author Note *: I know this may be unusual; rather than work on troubleshooting the code that is causing this, which would take time away from the paymentIntents integration, I worked around issues by doing this.)
-------------

## Getting started

From the Terminal screen from the /client directory:

[1] Type `sudo yarn`
[2] Type `sudo yarn start`
[3] Your default browser should now open with the front-end being served from `http://localhost:3000/`.
