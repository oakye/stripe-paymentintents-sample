This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

From the Terminal screen from the /client directory:

[1] Type `sudo yarn`
[2] Type `sudo yarn start`
[3] Your default browser should now open with the front-end being served from `http://localhost:3000/`.
